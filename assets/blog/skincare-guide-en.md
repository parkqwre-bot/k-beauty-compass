# A Detailed Step-by-Step Guide to Skincare

Skincare is about more than just applying good products. Following the correct order and usage for each step plays a crucial role in skin health. This guide provides a detailed explanation of the basic skincare steps, from cleansing to sun protection, and what to watch out for.

## 1. Cleansing
Cleansing is the first step to help your skin breathe by removing various impurities, sebum, and makeup residue.

- **Oil Cleanser**: Effective at dissolving and removing oil-based residues like makeup and sunscreen. Especially good for days with heavy makeup.

- **Foam Cleanser**: Used for a double cleanse after an oil cleanser to thoroughly wash away skin impurities. Oily skin types should opt for a foam cleanser, while dry skin types should choose a mild product with moisturizing ingredients.

**Caution**: Be cautious, as cleansing for too long or using products with strong detergency can lead to a damaged skin barrier and dryness.

## 2. Exfoliation
This step removes dead skin cells, softens the skin texture, and helps the absorption of subsequent products.

- Scrub products are suitable for use about 1-2 times a week; excessive use can cause skin damage.

- Chemical exfoliants (like AHA, BHA) are more suitable for sensitive skin and gently exfoliate the stratum corneum without irritation.

## 3. Toner
Used after cleansing to remove any remaining residue, refine skin texture, and restore pH balance.

- Oily skin should choose an astringent toner that helps with sebum control, while dry skin should select a hydrating toner focused on moisture supply.

- Patting the toner into the skin with your hands is better for reducing skin irritation than using a cotton pad.

## 4. Essence & Serum
This step involves highly concentrated active ingredients for targeted care of specific skin concerns.

- Select ingredients (like Vitamin C, Retinol, Peptides) that match your goals, such as brightening, wrinkle improvement, or firming.

- Apply a small amount evenly over the entire face, and apply a thicker layer on problem areas for intensive care.

## 5. Moisturizer
Provides a stable supply of moisture and oil to the skin to protect the skin barrier.

- Rich cream or balm types are suitable for dry skin, while light gel or oil-free products are appropriate for oily skin.

- It's recommended to use a product with UV protection during the day and a nutrient-rich product at night.

## 6. Sunscreen
An essential step to protect the skin from external UV rays, preventing skin aging and pigmentation.

- Use a 'broad-spectrum' sunscreen that blocks both UVA and UVB rays.

- Apply a sufficient amount (about 2mg/cmÂ² for adults) 30 minutes before going out every day, and reapply frequently if you sweat or get wet.
